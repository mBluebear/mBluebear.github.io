    <p>Anika is a Ottawa - based florist with a lovely variety of fresh flowers, silk flowers and creative gift ideas to suit any style or budget.In this project I want to focus on the freshness and beautiful of a blooming flower. Thus I put a blooming daisy on the last letter a in order to create a fresh and beautiful look.</p>

    <p>This is a logo for Deep thought Studio. Since this studio makes puzzle games (Crossword, Word search and Sudoku) for phone and tablet, I draw an Octopus wraps his tentacles around the word “deep thought”. I chose a rough font which represents rock for the word “deep thought”. Meanwhile, I put gradient on the word deep thought in order to show the “deep”. Besides, I use Orange for the octopus because orange is very catching and full of energy. It would help grab attention of the viewers.</p>

    <p>This is a concept art for a puzzle game ui. The game consists of four individual games (crossword, word search, sudoku and cross number) and tournament events. I created the game ui based on the owl theme since own is reputable for smart and wisdom in the animal kingdom. I also chose a fun whimsical typeface to fit the theme better.</p>

    <p>In this project, the English and French Financial Report for Cirque du Soleil was created. This Canadian entertainment company is the largest theatrical producer in the world. Cirque du Soleil is a dramatic mix of circus arts and street entertainment. The show is performed by many talented artists. It’s full of energy and vividly beautiful. I want to deliver these characteristics in to the report. To achieve this, I decide to create an abstract pattern with different shades of orange red to portrait the company’s energy and spirit. Since this is a very big company, I want to make the annual report in a clean corporate style.</p>

    <p>The theme of my booklet is love and friendship in the magical world of Winnie the Pooh. I was inspired by those heartbreakingly adorable quotes from the Winnie The Pooh cartoon. Thus, I decided to make a booklet for it. Handmade type was explored in this booklet. I use type and illustration to convey the meaning of each distinct quote and spirit of Winnie the Pooh. I made the whole booklet by hand using watercolour and pen. In addition, I experimented with different popup technique in order to make it looks interesting and engaging.</p>

    <p>A gift card package for Gymboree & Co., a retailer of high quality children’s apparel and accessories, was created in this project. In fact, Gymboree sells children apparel and accessories, which contains bright colours and cute patterns to attract the 0 to12 year-old kids. I want to create a gift card package goes well with the company product. To do that, I decide to make the gift card package in the mouse and cheese theme. My gift card contains pattern that looks like a piece of cheese. Meanwhile, the gift card package is a happy face of a mouse. The mouse’s mouth serves as a window so that when the gift card is slid inside, it still shows through.</p>

    <p>Monogamy is quite rare in animal kingdom. However, there are some scarce species which form monogamous pair bonds that last for many years or even for their whole lives. French angel fish , Adele penguin and swan are one of those faithful animals which I found very inspiring.
        In this project, an advertising campaign for Tiffany &Co. was created; the theme of the campaign was engagement and the target audiences are young couples who are around 20 to 30 years old.
        To illustrate for the ads, I drew three pair of these uplifting animals which I mentioned above. I created these drawing in a classy realistic style. In each illustration, I draw the animals in a way that they looked like real persons who were very happy and in love; in addition, Tiffany & Co  is popular for their blue box so that I made the male carrying the company’s signature box to propose the female. The animal were hand drawn with pencil and the box were painted in Photoshop. The slogan I wrote was “It’s for life” which implied that this was a very precious ring; it could be kept and treasured for life.
        Moreover, since engagement is a memorable romantic event, I put watercolour brushes in the background around the animal pairs to create a dreamy and tender effect on these ads.</p>

    <p>Sara Beauty is a home based Spa Business in Nepean/ Ottawa area. It was established two years ago. In this project, a new logo is designed for Sara
        Beauty to help the company image becomes more professional to stand out from other home spas in the area.
        I created a logo that looks simple, elegant and modern but also maintains the feminine look at the same time. 
        Besides, the spa uses only the finest products which contain only natural ingredients. To emphasize that, I decide to play with the letter r in the word Sara. I make the body of r in a branch shape, and the leaf as the tail of the letter r.</p>
